   description="Kia Ora, I'm Frankie Johns, a local student in Whangārei with a deep passion for the arts. The inspiration to revive NAFF struck during a rehearsal for Northland Youth Theatre's production of The Happy Prince while sitting on the iconic ONEONESIX couches. The idea of resurrecting The Northland Amateur Filmmakers festival emerged, aiming to build a community for filmmakers in Te Tai Tokerau. This community seeks to nurture talent, utilizing Northland's industry expertise, as you'll discover below. The revival of NAFF in Whangārei is truly exciting, fostering a supportive environment for filmmakers and like-minded individuals."
