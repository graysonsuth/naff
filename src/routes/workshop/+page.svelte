This hands-on experience is all about turning personal stories and bold ideas into production-ready scripts. With only 20 spots available, participants from across Northland will work in small teams to create 5–10 original screenplays, guided by two expert facilitators. Whether you're a writer, storyteller, or budding filmmaker, this is your chance to gain real-world skills, collaborate creatively, and bring your vision to life on the page."
